# Personal Portfolio Site

Personal Portfolio Site is a site that advertises a budding web developer. It is targeted at both recruiters looking for a web developer to hire, and other developers looking for someone to collaborate with them on their projects. This will be useful, for recruiters and developers alike, to be able to assess whether the advertised developer is a good fit for the role they are hiring for, and for them to get in touch if so.
